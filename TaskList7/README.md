## Reduced the amount of stuff in Notebooks.

The Amount of lines generated by Jupyter Notebook
overwhelmed the statistics of code in this repository.
To keep the detected label for repo as "Python"
I reduced the notebooks and simplified (*minified*) them.


To get the original Jupyter Notebooks [get this commit](https://github.com/Luzkan/PythonCourse/commit/bdc0f8e65d54d9e6d638ba43f0eb71288aa71988). *Better storytelling and bonus method for image object detection included. :3*
